Each directory Socket0-15 must contain either ~~~RAM or ~~~ROM which determine
whether the corresponding socket is RAM or ROM.

You may also put a ROM image in one of the directories to automatically load
it into that socket number when 6502Em is run.

VDFS is in socket 13 by default.

Socket 15 is ingored in all modes (will contain BASIC or Terminal).
Sockets 15,14,12,11,10,9 are ignored in Master 128 mode.
Sockets 15 & 14 are ignored in Master Compact mode.
