!6502Em v5.00 release candidate + source, 1st March 2014
 -> 32bit updated source is contained within the dir !6502Em.AllSource
 -> source screen tables are in !6502Em.Tables and !6502Em.Tables_HR
!ImageDFS v0.90b, 11th January 2014
ModeDefs (required for Iyonix, RiscPC and OMAP boards)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

To use:

To use !ImageDFS and !6502em, load both applications. Then drag a .ssd/.dsd
file to the !6502em icon on the icon bar. (Without loading ImageDFS, the
emulator can still load some .ssd files, but functionality is not complete
and DDFS images / double sided images are not supported).

For Iyonix, RiscPC or OMAP3/4 based computer, you may need to install
additional screen modes in your mode definition file. See file 'ModeDefs'.
These are not required on the Raspberry Pi (because it uses the AnyMode
module instead).

Notes:

!6502Em v5.00

Known issues to fix before release...
1) Only tested on RISC OS 5, and **not expected to work on 26bit RISC OS**
2) Electron emulation is not available (missing source, so could not 32bit)
3) Screen modes 1-6 sometimes appear with all-black palette
4) Use of 32bit/ArmV7 (strict) CPU settings not fully tested


!ImageDFS v0.90b

This has not been updated since "beta-test", but should work on all RISC OS
from 3.1-5.2+
