ImageDFS v0.90 read only, problems file         © Stephen Harrison, 1996-2014
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This file lists some solutions to possible problems you may encounter with
ImageDFS.


Problem : Double-clicking a DFS file from the desktop causes internal error.
Cause(s): You are trying to run a BBC-only program from the RiscOS desktop.
Solution: Try using the !6502em BBC emulator to load this file, it will
          run almost all BBC programs perfectly.

Problem : You can't save a file to a DFS disc/image.
Cause(s): ImageDFS v0.90 is read only, so you cannot save to DFS discs.
Solution: Try contacting the author to see whether a read/write
          version of ImageDFS will become available.

Problem : Clicking on 5¼" disc drive icon, with DFS disc in, returns error.
Cause(s): 1) ImageDFS module is not loaded or has been removed,
          2) External drive is switched off,
          3) 5¼" drive is not connected to computer correctly.
Solution: 1) Re-load ImageDFS.
          2) If you have an externally powered 5¼" drive check it is plugged
             in and switched on.
          3) (Common problem) check you have the correct leads for the drive,
             to test if it works properly, try formatting an ADFS 5¼" disc to
             ADFS 640K. If this works the drive is ok.

Problem : Double-clicking, or loading a DFS file causes a disc error.
Cause(s): 1) The 5¼" drive is not set to 80 tracks,
          2) You are trying to load a 40 track copy-protected disc which
             ImageDFS thinks is 80 tracks.
Solution: 1) Switch the disc drive to 80 track mode and try again.
          2) Select the '40 track only' option from ImageDFS's options window
             - see ReadMe file for more information.

Problem : Typing *DRIVE 0, then *. in the BBC emulator does not access the
          correct DFS disc.
Cause(s): 1) You are not using !6502em, or have an old version (before v1.60),
          2) The DFS / ADFS drive mapping is wrong,
          3) The ImageDFS module is not loaded or has been removed.
Solution: 1) Upgrade to the latest version of !6502em available from
             www.brocherds.co.uk
          2) See the second half of the ReadMe file for details on how to
             correct the drive mapping for your computer setup.
          3) Re-load ImageDFS.
