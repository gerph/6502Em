OP05:This tells ImageDFS to use system routines to detect DFS discs.|MThis can be very slow if the 'Load ImageDFS for fast detection' option is not selected, as RiscOS can then mistake DFS discs for normal ADFS discs with errors on!
OP06:When this is selected ImageDFS sets disc retries to 0 to improve preformance if the 'Load ImageDFS for fast detection' is not selected.
OP07:When selected, ImageDFS uses special routines to load 'in front' of the operating system, allowing fast detection of DFS discs.|MIf unselected, ImageDFS is loaded normally but this can result in DFS discs taking a long time to access.
OP08/OP09:When using ImageDFS with 40 track discs, some game copy-protection systems can trick it into thinking the disc is 80 track - causing an error. If this is selected ImageDFS will only read 40 track discs - so the protection systems work.
OP12/OP13:This sets ImageDFS to format all discs with 62 file catalogues. Discs formatted with 62 file catalogues can store more files, but will only work correctly on BBC computers fitted with Watford Electronics DFS or DDFS.
OP14/OP15:This option sets ImageDFS to format DDFS discs (which are not readable on Acorn DFS), with Watford DDFS 62 file catalogues, and DFS discs with Acorn DFS 31 file catalogues.
OP16/OP17:If you intend to use DDFS discs formatted with ImageDFS on BBC computers using Solidisk DDFS, you should select this option as it formats both DDFS and DFS discs to have 31 file catalogues.
OP20:Select this if you want ImageDFS to load without the desktop part of the program. This saves 96K of memory when using ImageDFS.
OP??:From this window you can choose the start-up options for ImageDFS.

OW03:This saves the current start-up options as the default settings.
OW02:This restores the previous configuration settings.
OW01:This sets ImageDFS to use the current settings, but does not save them.
OW??:From this window you can choose the start-up options for ImageDFS.

DS10/DS11/DS12/DS13:Drag this icon to either of the DFS disc drive icons to select which ADFS disc drive is accessed by the BBC emulator.
DS14:Drag an ADFS drive icon to this icon to so the BBC emulator uses that drive when *Drive 0 is issued.
DS15:Drag an ADFS drive icon to this icon to so the BBC emulator uses that drive when *Drive 1 is issued.
DS19:This sets the current drive mapping settings to be used.
DS17:This saves the current settings as the default settings.
DS18:This restores the previous drive mapping settings.
DS??:This window allows user selection of which ADFS disc drives are available to the BBC emulator.

FT00:Select this icon if you want DFS files to appear with RiscOS icons in filer windows.
FT06:This icon display shows the current RiscOS filetype being edited.
FT02/FT01:If a DFS file's load address matches the address here (numbers replaced with 'x's are not compared), and it's exec address matches the address below, it will appear with the filetype given above.
FT04/FT03:If a DFS file's exec address matches the address here (numbers replaced with 'x's are not compared), and it's load address matches the address above, it will appear with the filetype given above.
FT??:This window allows user defined filetype translation, so that DFS files appear with RiscOS icons on the desktop.

AT??:These are the RiscOS filetypes currently mapped to DFS load/exec addresses. They are displayed in priority order, so the first types are tested before the last.
